In Next.js 15, a seemingly innocuous change to the `next.config.js` file can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly. For instance, if you modify the `images` object to include a new domain, or change the `domains` array within the existing configuration,  you might encounter issues with image optimization and loading, even if the new domain is correctly configured and accessible.  This is because Next.js's image optimization relies heavily on the configuration provided in `next.config.js`, and any discrepancy between the configuration and the actual image source can cause it to fail silently or generate runtime errors.  The error might not be immediately apparent, as it may manifest as broken images or blank spaces on your pages instead of a clear error message in the console. This is exacerbated when using features like image optimization or remote images. For example, if an image url is `https://newdomain.com/image.jpg`, but `newdomain.com` is not listed in the `images.domains` array of `next.config.js`, the image will not load.
