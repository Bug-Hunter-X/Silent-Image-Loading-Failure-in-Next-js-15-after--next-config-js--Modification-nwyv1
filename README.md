# Silent Image Loading Failure in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 related to image optimization and configuration changes in `next.config.js`.  After modifying the `images` object (specifically the `domains` array), images may fail to load without any clear error messages.

## Bug Description
Modifying the `images` section of `next.config.js` to include new image domains or alter existing ones can lead to unexpected behavior. Images sourced from the newly added or modified domains might fail to load, resulting in broken images or empty spaces on the page.  The console may not show any relevant errors, making debugging challenging.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Observe the initial state where images load correctly.
4. Modify `next.config.js` to change or add to the `images.domains` array.  For instance, add a new domain.
5. Restart the development server.
6. Notice that images from the new domain may fail to load without any clear error messages in the console.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the `next.config.js` file accurately reflects all domains from which images are being sourced.  Any inconsistencies between the configuration and the actual image URLs will lead to loading issues.

## Additional Notes
This bug highlights the importance of carefully managing the `images` configuration in Next.js 15, especially when dealing with remote images or deploying applications using multiple image domains.  Always double-check your configuration after making any changes and thoroughly test image loading from all relevant sources.
