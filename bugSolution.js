The solution is to meticulously verify the `next.config.js` file's `images` configuration.  Ensure that the `domains` array within the `images` object includes *all* domains from which your application fetches images.  If you add a new domain from which to serve images, you must update the `domains` array accordingly.  After making changes, restart your Next.js development server. If you are using a CDN, make sure you properly configure it and that it allows requests from your Next.js application. 

Here's an example of correct configuration:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['example.com', 'newdomain.com'],
  },
};
```

If you still encounter problems, try clearing your browser's cache and checking your browser's developer console for any network errors or warnings related to image loading.
